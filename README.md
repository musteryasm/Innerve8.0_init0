# Intelligent Intrusion Detection System

The Intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is designed to enhance network security by identifying and preventing unauthorized access or malicious activities. It employs machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze network traffic and detect potential intrusions.

## Project Structure

1. **Admin App** - Django dashboard for administrators to monitor and manage the system.

2. **Attack** - Folders containing demo attacks for testing purposes.
   - Host-based attacks/
   - DOS_attack/
   
3. **Models**
   - `main (1).ipynb`: Machine learning and deep learning data model pipeline.
   - `preprocessed_compiled_data.ipynb`: Data preprocessing and visualizations.

4. **Sniffer**
   - `snif.py`: Packet sniffer written in Python for low latency and custom feature extraction based on feature importance in preprocessing.
